// 
// The CSS asset package for the "commits" app.
// 
// It's a good pattern to organize your asset packages by a package per app. 
// This stylesheet pacakge is very simple and just uses the stylesheets from
// the commits app. However a more complex app might need to piece together
// some components stylesheets such as styles for a layout component, an
// autocomplete components, etc. In this case you would stack more @import
// into this file.
